# The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms

Informally, an algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as input, and produces some value, or set of values, as output. An algorithm is thus the sequence of computational steps that transforms an input into an output.

Here is how we formally define the *sorting problem*:

**Input**: A sequence of *n* numbers ⟨a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ..., a<sub>n</sub>⟩.

**Output**: A permutation (reordering) ⟨a′<sub>1</sub>, a′<sub>2</sub>, ..., a′<sub>n</sub>⟩ of the input sequence such that a′<sub>1</sub> ≤ a′<sub>2</sub> ≤ ... ≤ a′<sub>n</sub>.

For example, given ⟨31,41,59,26,41,58⟩, a sorting algorithm returns as output the sequence ⟨26, 31, 41, 41, 58, 59⟩.
