# VI Graph Algorithms

Graph problems pervade computer science, and algorithms for working with them are fundamental to the field. Hundreds of interesting computational problems are couched in terms of graphs.

Chapter 22 shows how we can represent a graph in a computer and then discusses algorithms based on searching a graph using either breadth-first search or depth-first search.

Chapter 23 describes how to compute the minimum-weight spanning tree of a graph: the least-weight way of connecting all the vertices together when each edge has an associated weight.

Chapters 24 and 25 consider how to compute shortest paths between vertices when each edge has an associated length or "weight."

Chapter 26 shows how to compute a maximum flow of material in a flow network, which is a directed graph having a specified source vertex of material.
